// @ts-nocheck — vanilla DOM client utility
// Animates a segmented-switch's active-position indicator — a "thumb" that
// slides behind the active segment — on click. Used site-wide (see
// AnimatedSwitch.astro, mounted once in BaseLayout) for every
// role="radiogroup" segmented switch: ModeToggle, ViewToggle,
// HashCalculator's Input source switch, IocExtractor's fang row,
// DorkBuilder's engine row, and ThemePicker's two vertical palette lists —
// see AnimatedSwitch.astro's header for the retrofit contract; nothing below
// needs to change for a future switch to pick it up. Slides horizontally
// (translateX) by default; a group with `aria-orientation="vertical"` (only
// ThemePicker's palette lists today) slides vertically (translateY) instead
// — same attribute those lists already carry for their own arrow-key nav, so
// there's no separate opt-in convention to remember.
//
// 150ms/ease-out — deliberately snappy (matches this codebase's existing
// "fast UI feedback" rhythm — segBtn/modeBtn/engineBtn's own `transition:
// all 150ms ease` hover states use the exact same duration), NOT the
// ~0.45-0.5s timing this codebase uses elsewhere for reveals (animatedDetails.ts,
// the nav dropdown's `.nav-more-menu`, `declassify-hero`). Those are staged,
// once-per-load (or once-per-open) reveals meant to read as a decode. A
// switch thumb is direct-manipulation UI feedback tracking a click that
// already happened — it has to feel immediate, not staged, or the control
// reads as laggy. (Originally shipped at 220ms — dropped to 150ms after it
// still read as sluggish once the double-indicator bug below was found and
// fixed; a slower thumb was partly masking/competing with the second
// indicator rather than the duration alone being the problem.)
//
// IMPORTANT — suppressing the redundant per-button indicator: every switch's
// button already carries its own `&[data-active]` background/border/shadow
// (the pre-existing, JS-free, fully-accessible flat color swap). Once this
// script arms a thumb, that per-button background becomes a SECOND,
// independently-timed indicator (its own 150ms CSS `transition: all`) racing
// the thumb's animate() call — the two don't share a clock, so for a window
// mid-transition you'd see the newly-active button's own background already
// fully lit via CSS while the thumb (also fully-colored) is still visibly
// sliding across the *other*, still-unselected buttons underneath: a
// double-indicator flicker that reads as broken, not as one switch. The fix
// is NOT to delete the per-button background from each component's CSS —
// that background is the only indicator reduced-motion/no-JS visitors ever
// see (this script returns before creating anything under reduced motion —
// see below), so removing it would break that fallback. Instead, once the
// thumb has actually been placed at a real position for the first time —
// inside place(), past its `if (!w) return` guard, NOT unconditionally right
// after the thumb element is created — this script sets `data-switch-armed`
// on the GROUP; a single hand-written global rule in motion.css —
// `[data-switch-armed] [role='radio'][data-active] { background: transparent;
// border-color: transparent; box-shadow: none; }` — suppresses ONLY the
// background/border/shadow (never the active-state text/icon `color`, which
// stays a normal, non-competing 150ms fade layered on top of the sliding
// thumb) and ONLY while a thumb actually exists to replace it. This is a
// single shared rule, not a per-consumer Panda override: the natural way to
// author this in each component's own css() — a nested condition like
// `{'[data-switch-armed] &': {'&[data-active]': {...}}}` — does NOT compile
// to a real compound selector (confirmed by inspecting the compiled CSS
// directly; it collapses to a plain `.btn[data-active]` rule with the
// ancestor check only baked into the generated class name, never into an
// actual selector, so it unconditionally won on source order regardless of
// whether the group was armed). No-JS/reduced-motion visitors never see
// `data-switch-armed` at all, so their experience is byte-for-byte unchanged
// from before this feature existed.
//
// No-ops entirely under prefers-reduced-motion — mirrors animatedDetails.ts's
// own shape (idempotent init guard, then an immediate reduced-motion bailout
// before touching the DOM at all). Each switch's plain `[data-active]` color
// swap, already rendered server-side with no JS required, is a fully correct
// and fully accessible control on its own — the thumb is a pure enhancement
// layer painted in behind the button content, never required for
// correctness. A belt-and-suspenders `.switch-thumb { transition: none }`
// rule still lives in motion.css's reduced-motion block (see that file) in
// case anything outside this guard ever adds the class.
//
// Thumb coloring is *not* hardcoded per component: on every placement this
// clones the currently-active button's own resolved background/border/
// shadow/radius via getComputedStyle and copies it onto the thumb, so colors
// always match that switch's own theme exactly — including staying in sync
// across a live palette change (see the `themechange` listener below) — with
// zero color-matching code required in any consuming component. Combined
// with the group being the thumb's only required markup change (see
// AnimatedSwitch.astro), a future switch needs nothing beyond
// `position: 'relative', zIndex: 0` on its track.
//
// Groups can be hidden (`display: none`) at the moment this runs — every
// WorkspaceShell-based tool (Hash Calculator, IOC Extractor, Dork Builder)
// stays hidden until its OWN script marks it ready, and this script's mount
// point in BaseLayout runs before any of those, so `place()` reads 0 for
// offsetLeft/offsetWidth on the first pass. A ResizeObserver on the group
// re-places the thumb (unanimated) whenever its size changes — including the
// display:none → flex flip — so the thumb self-corrects the instant the
// track actually becomes visible, without this script needing to run after
// every consumer's own script. This is exactly why `data-switch-armed` is
// set inside `place()` on its first SUCCESSFUL placement rather than
// unconditionally at setup: if it were set up front, a group still hidden
// at that point would have its fallback indicator suppressed with nothing
// yet in its place — neither indicator visible — for however long the
// ResizeObserver takes to fire. Gating the attribute on real placement
// means the fallback stays visible right up until the thumb has something
// real to show, so there is never a frame with no visible indicator at all.

  // script (e.g. ModeToggle's sync()) sets `data-active` on the button
  // *synchronously*, which starts that CSS transition from transparent
  // toward the real color; this function then runs one requestAnimationFrame
  // later and can catch that transition still mid-flight. `getAnimations()
  // [].finish()` was tried first to settle it before reading, but a

  // moment ago, not the one the mode actually just changed to. This is what

  // specifically: a click there also runs window.__theme.setMode(), which
  // wraps the DOM update in document.startViewTransition() (the full-page
  // theme-wipe, see BaseHead.astro's applyAnimated()) — a second click fired
  // before that transition settles calls skipTransition() on the first one,
  // and that interaction could leave the click listener's scheduled place()
  // reading data-active before the second click's own update had actually
  // landed, stranding the thumb at the *previous* selection even though the
  // page had already switched modes (the button's own icon color updated
  // correctly regardless, since that's a plain CSS attribute selector with
  // no timing dependency — only the thumb, and the color cloned from it,
  // stayed stuck). A MutationObserver has no such race: it fires once per
  // batch of attribute changes no matter what caused them or how many
  // happened in a row, and always reads whatever data-active *currently* is
  // at delivery time — necessarily the final state after all synchronous
  // click handling (of however many rapid clicks) has already completed.
  // This is also why IOC Extractor's fang-row switch and every other switch
  // that doesn't trigger a page-wide transition never showed this bug: their
  // click listener's own next-frame callback never had anything else in
  // flight to race against. A rapid repeat click retargeting the thumb
  // mid-flight is still correct, expected UX (motion/mini's animate()
  // naturally redirects from the thumb's current live position — see
