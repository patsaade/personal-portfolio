// Network Port Reference — TCP/UDP well-known + registered ports that matter
// for DFIR (single source of truth for /network-ports/ and per-port detail
// pages /network-ports/[slug]/). Same rigor as eventIds.ts: every entry was
// researched, then independently adversarially fact-checked (a second pass
// of skeptics specifically trying to REFUTE each claim, not just confirm it)
// before inclusion — 4 entries were caught making a false claim during that
// pass and corrected rather than silently kept; nothing here is guessed at.
//
// `slug` is `{protocol}-{port}` (e.g. "tcp-443") for a port used on ONLY one
// transport; genuinely dual-protocol services use `port-{port}` (e.g.
// "port-53") instead, since giving DNS two separate tcp-53/udp-53 entries
// would duplicate identical content for no reason. `rangeType` is computed,
// not hand-entered — RFC 6335's three IANA tiers (System/Well-Known 0-1023,
// User/Registered 1024-49151, Dynamic/Private/Ephemeral 49152-65535) applied
// mechanically to `port`. No entry lives in the dynamic range on purpose:
// that range is never assigned to a named service by definition (any host
// picks one transiently per connection), so there's nothing to catalog
// individually there — see the "Understanding port ranges" section on the
// index page for what an analyst should know about it instead.
//
// `confidence` is the DFIR-relevant question "how solid is this port-to-
// service mapping": `iana-registered` means IANA's own registry assigns this
// port to this service; `de-facto-standard` means the port is genuinely,
// overwhelmingly used this way in practice but IANA's registry actually
// assigns it to something else or nothing at all (Squid/3128, Oracle/1521,
// Elasticsearch/9200, and the pcsync-https/8443 mixup are the concrete
// examples below — each says so explicitly in its own `what`); and
// `historical-documented` covers the whole "Malware & C2" category, where
// there is no registration authority at all and the port-to-tool mapping
// rests entirely on historical/vendor/threat-intel documentation, not a
// protocol spec — treat those as a pivot point, never a confirmed finding.

It is also the near-universal fallback: most modern sites use 80 only to redirect to 443, so persistent plaintext traffic on 80 rather than a single redirect can indicate a legacy or misconfigured service, an internal tool, or malware avoiding the overhead of TLS.",
